# Assignment 12

This is the readme for session-12. This file contains information for functions present in `polygon.py` and `polygon_seq.py`.

Polygons (sequence) type has been refactored into an iterable.

- Polygon class is in `polygon.py`.
- PolygonSeq class in `polygon_seq.py`.
- Both classses are tested in `main.ipynb`.

This session had the following topics -

#### Lazy Iterables

#### In-Built Iterables

#### Sorting Iterables

#### The iter() function

#### Iterating Callables

#### Delegating Iterators

#### Reversed Iteration

#### Using Iterators as function arguments

The starting point for this project is the Polygon class and the Polygons sequence type created in the previous session (11).
